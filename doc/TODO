- Implement some way to do not allocate VertexCollection
  vertices dinamically. The sizes are know at compilation
  time, so it's possible to optimize the code.
- Add GridBuilder::build2D verification to know if the
  input gridData is 2D or 3D.
- At TestCase "Grid read 2D", section "triangular elements
  centroid", add handles test or implement an
    bool operator==(Vertex,Vertex)
- Create a way to alloc memory to an Element when it
  is created. Therefore the function Element::addVertex
  will not allocate memory.
  I'd like to create an element as a template class that
  receives the number of vertices.
